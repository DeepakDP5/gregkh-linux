Things I don't want to forget, might as well track them here.

 - cdev stuff

 - buy a power controller for ktest:
	http://www.digital-loggers.com/lpc.html

  - cross compilers from David Howwells http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/cross/ into openSUSE.

  - make dev_printk() "smarter" about finding a "real" device to print from, to
    make it more useful for people (see input thread for why this is needed)

  - kernel patches to make llvm build/link
  	http://git.linuxfoundation.org/?p=llvm-setup.git;a=tree;hb=HEAD

  - remove __devX as it's pretty much pointless

  - git quiltimport -c 2  (only apply X number of patches...)

  - no more attributes, use attribute groups

  - no more device_create_file(), use groups

  - DEVICE_ATTR_R*, not "raw" ones if at all possible.

  - sysfs binary file creation moved to groups for all drivers

  - no more driver calls to sysfs_* at all if possible.

  - PCI MSI sysfs files, an attribute group instead of a kobject mess?

  kernel_fpu_begin()/end
	- only do it once, and then restore on return to userspace only if set.

 - move more function pointers into read-only structures.  Like tty ops and usb and others.
